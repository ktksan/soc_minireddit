Project: ANONY-CHAT
IIT-K SUMMER OF CODE : WEB APP DEVELOPMENT    
Sponsored by Nutanix, UP SIDC Under Prof. Sandeep Shukla 

The idea was to create a campus centric social media where people could retain their anonymity and interact with other users sharing similar interests by forming communities with the ability to post, like and comment. The app also has a Random Chat feature where people will be allowed to chat with random strangers while retaining their anonymity.

User Interface built using Flutter Backend- Firebase Real Time Database
